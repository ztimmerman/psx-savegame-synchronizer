# psx-savegame-synchronizer

Automated scripting to facilitate converting original PlayStation save games between the format used for PS2's uLaunchELF, Retroarch, and PSP.

## Project Goals

### Supported formats:

- The single save format used by uLaunchELF homebrew software on PS2
- Retroarch's memory card format, SRM
- Virtual Memory Card PSP (.vmp)

### Why develop this?
Previous save game translators like MemCardRex focus primarily on Windows systems. I want a more universal application, so this will focus on a Python graphical application that is platform-agnostic.
